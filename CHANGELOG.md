# Changelog

Functional changes to released `tool.scad-project` versions.

## v0.7.2

### Changed

- Bound reusable Build and Verify jobs to 15 minutes.
- Bound setup, lint, artifact and publication steps to 2 minutes.
- Bound design rendering, configured output builds and verification work to 5 minutes.
- Bound the tool test workflow to 15 minutes and the release workflow to 10 minutes.
- Add regression coverage for the workflow timeout policy.


## v0.7.1

### Fixed

- Align the package runtime version and reusable workflow version markers with the released tool version.
- Add regression coverage so package and workflow version markers cannot silently drift apart again.

## v0.7.0

### Added

- Directory-based OpenSCAD build discovery through configured `render_root` and `export_root` paths.
- Optional `render.yml` and `export.yml` build profiles beside entrypoints.
- Multi-size profile expansion using `sizes`, passed to OpenSCAD as `-D size="..."`.
- Profile-level PNG `image_size` overrides with directory defaults and project-level fallback.

### Changed

- Explicit `builds:` entries remain supported as compatibility/exception overrides instead of being required for every normal render/export entrypoint.

## v0.6.1

### Added

- Unified `publication-info.txt` provenance for generated build and verification output.
- Immutable SCAD toolchain image/version recorded by reusable workflows.
- `tool.scad-project` release recorded with generated output.
- Runtime component inventory from `scad-toolchain-info`, including the actual
  OpenSCAD, PythonSCAD, BOSL2, pybosl2, Shapely, docsgen and Pillow versions.

### Changed

- `publication-info.txt` is the current-generation replacement for the classic
  `openscad-build.txt` metadata concept.

## v0.6.0

### Added

- SCAD toolchain v0.4.0 runtime baseline.
- Project-controlled PNG watermark orchestration through
  `rendering.watermark.text`.
- Public `scad-image-watermark` runtime integration.
- Permanent release workflow for immutable tool releases.
